# Changelog Action

This GitHub Action generates a changelog between two container image versions by inspecting their package lists (RPMs) using `skopeo` and verifying attestation with `cosign`.

It supports both explicit tag comparison and automatic tag discovery based on a release stream (e.g., `stable`, `latest`).

## Contribute compute — no code needed

**[Donate time with your AI CLI](https://hub.tunaos.org/#contribute).**

Your machine runs one task at a time using your signed-in AI coding CLI.
The relay alternates between eligible **School** (OS) and **Reef** (apps)
hives after each task. If one hive has no work, the other can continue.

The guide covers prerequisites, verified `just` setup, credentials, provider
costs, and how to stop with Ctrl+C. Your subscription quota or API charges apply.
Never post account credentials or API keys in issues or pull requests.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Generate Changelog
  uses: tuna-os/changelog-action@master
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io/tuna-os/
    cosign-key: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuna-os/tunaos/main/cosign.pub
    images: bonito skipjack
    stream: stable
    output: changelog.md
```

> Note: This action is currently unversioned on `tuna-os/changelog-action`, so consumers pin a moving branch (`@master`).
> The default branch is planned to be renamed `master` -> `main`. **Update consumer references to `@main` once that rename has occurred.**
